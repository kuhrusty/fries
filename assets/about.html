<p>This is a support app for <a href="https://cheapass.com/">Cheapass Games</a>'
<a href="https://cheapass.com/lord-of-the-fries/">Lord of the Fries</a>.  Its
purpose is to display the ingredients for the current order large enough for
everyone at the table to see.</p>

<p>Almost all of the text &amp; images are property of Cheapass Games and are,
uhh, sort of <a href="https://github.com/kuhrusty/fries/issues/1">used without
permission</a>.  So, uhh, that's not exactly cool.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>There are a couple ways to use this thing.</b>  One is to manually enter
the ingredients when an order is rolled or called.  Another is to use the
<b>Call</b> button to call an order, or the <b>Roll</b> button (which looks
like a fast food icon... I
<a href="https://github.com/kuhrusty/fries/issues/3">haven't made a d6 icon</a>
yet) to roll an order.</p>

<p>The <b>-1 button</b> is just for keeping track of how many times an order
has gone around the table.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>This program is open source!</b>  If you want to fiddle with the source
code, it's on <a href="https://github.com/kuhrusty/fries">GitHub</a>.</p>
